# Blockchain RSVP Tutorial

This is the code repository for a tutorial series on building a Web3 application with a Python / Flask backend.

The application is a blockchain-based events / RSVP app that allows users to connect their wallet, browse and RSVP to events, and pay a fee (in Ether) for an event they plan to attend. If the user attends the event, their Ether will be refunded. If they fail to attend, their Ether will be forfeited and distributed equally (by the event owner/host) among users who did attend.
