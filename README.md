## Episode 1 - Designing our Application

This is the code repo for the first episode in a YouTube tutorial series on building a Web3 application with a Python / Flask backend.

This application is a blockchain-based events / RSVP app that allows users to connect their wallet, browse and RSVP to events, and pay an ETH fee for an event they plan to attend. If the user attends the event, their ETH will be refunded. If they don't attend, their ETH will be forfeited and distributed equally (by the event owner/host) among users who did attend.

In this episode, we walked through creating a lightweight design for the application - consisting of user stories, a wireframe UI,  and an ERD data model. These artifacts are included in this repo in the Design Documents folder.
